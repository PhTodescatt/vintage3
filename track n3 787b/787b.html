                    <h1>|-History and Development</h1>
                    <a>The Mazda 787B was developed by Mazda to compete in the Group C racing category during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Group C was a top-tier racing series that featured highly advanced prototype cars, and it was renowned for pushing the limits of engineering, speed, and endurance. Mazda's involvement in Group C racing began in the 1980s, with the company gradually developing a reputation for its innovative use of the rotary engine — a unique and unconventional engine design that had both pros and cons when compared to traditional piston engines.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>Mazda had already made waves in motorsport with the 787 (a predecessor to the 787B) and the earlier 757 and 767 models, but the 787B represented a significant leap forward. The car was designed to be a high-performance machine capable of competing with the likes of Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Jaguar, all of whom were dominant forces in Group C racing at the time.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>To ensure the 787B’s competitiveness, Mazda partnered with Mazda’s motorsport division, Mazda Motorsport (Mazda Speed), and assembled a team of top engineers, mechanics, and drivers to develop the car. The result was a lightweight, highly aerodynamic race car that could handle the demanding 24-hour endurance race at Le Mans.</a>
                    <h2>Engine and Performance</h2>
                    <a>The Mazda 787B is perhaps most famous for its rotary engine, specifically the 4-rotor Wankel rotary engine that powered the car to victory at the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans. This engine, known as the R26B, was a major departure from the typical piston engines used by most of Mazda's competitors.</a>    
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>The R26B engine featured four rotors, which were a configuration rarely used in motorsport at the time. It produced an impressive 700 horsepower at 9,000 rpm, and despite being smaller and lighter than a typical piston engine of similar output, the rotary engine was capable of delivering exceptional power and high-revving performance. The engine’s relatively simple design and compact size also made it lighter and more efficient than many traditional engines, which was crucial for a race car that had to endure the grueling 24-hour race.</a>  
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>The 4-rotor Wankel engine was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, and the car's power was sent to the rear wheels. The rotary engine’s ability to rev quickly and maintain consistent power throughout the race was a key factor in the 787B's success at Le Mans. One of the notable features of the rotary engine was its smoothness and distinctive sound — a high-pitched whine that was unique to Mazda's rotary-powered cars.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>The 787B’s lightweight construction, combined with the high power-to-weight ratio of the engine, allowed the car to achieve blistering acceleration and impressive top speeds. It was capable of reaching speeds over 200 mph (320 km/h) on the straights of Le Mans, and its endurance over the 24-hour race was unparalleled, allowing it to maintain performance even during the toughest conditions.</a>
