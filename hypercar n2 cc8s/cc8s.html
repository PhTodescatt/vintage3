                    <h1>|-Engine and Performance</h1>
                    <a>At the heart of the CC8S was a 4.7-liter V8 engine, developed by Koenigsegg and mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. The engine produced an impressive 655 horsepower and 550 Nm (406 lb-ft) of torque, which enabled the CC8S to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in just 3.2 seconds. The car's top speed was an astonishing 240 mph (386 km/h), making it one of the fastest cars in the world at the time of its release.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>The powertrain featured advanced engineering, with the engine designed for both high performance and reliability. The CC8S was equipped with a twin supercharger system, which provided the engine with an extra boost of power at high revs. Additionally, the car featured a lightweight carbon fiber monocoque chassis, which helped keep the overall weight low, contributing to its exceptional handling and performance characteristics.</a>
                    <h2>Design and Features</h2>
                    <a>The design of the Koenigsegg CC8S was sleek, aerodynamic, and aggressive, with a distinctive look that set it apart from other hypercars. The car featured a low, wide stance, with smooth lines and a unique rear spoiler that provided both aesthetic appeal and functional aerodynamics. The body was constructed from carbon fiber and lightweight composites, which contributed to both strength and weight savings.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>Inside, the CC8S was designed with a minimalist approach, with a focus on performance and driver experience. The cabin was outfitted with luxury touches, including leather upholstery and high-tech instrumentation. Despite its racing-inspired design, the CC8S was relatively practical for a hypercar, offering comfortable seats and space for two passengers.</a>   
                    <h2>Technology and Innovation</h2>
                    <a>Koenigsegg was known for pushing the boundaries of automotive technology, and the CC8S featured several innovative systems, many of which were ahead of their time. One notable feature was the "Triplex" suspension system, which was a three-shock absorber setup for the rear axle, helping to improve stability and handling, particularly at high speeds and under heavy braking.</a>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <a>The car also incorporated active aerodynamics, with adjustable rear flaps that could adapt based on speed to optimize downforce and reduce drag. This attention to detail and the use of cutting-edge technology was part of what set the Koenigsegg CC8S apart from its competitors in the hypercar market.</a>
